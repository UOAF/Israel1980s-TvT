# Falcon BMS 4.35 - Israel 1980s TvT Theater
It's a mod of the official Falcon BMS 4.35 Israel theater (just like [Israel1980s](https://github.com/UOAF/Israel1980s)), optimized for 1980s-style TvT operations by nerfing aircraft avionics and systems, as well as limiting loadout options in order to provide a foundation for hosting both balanced and asymmetrical TvT events.

## How to install?
* Download and install the official [Israel Theater Of Operations for BMS 4.35](https://www.benchmarksims.org/forum/showthread.php?40653-Israel-Theater-Of-Operations-for-BMS-4-35) (currently version 4.35U0). This is required to use Israel 1980s TvT, since it allows the latter to only require 120MB of disk space by referencing all other 8GB of terrain/texture files from the official Israel theater;

* Unzip "Add-On Israel1980s TvT" into "Falcon BMS 4.35\Data\";

* Open the "Falcon BMS 4.35\Data\TerrData\TheaterDefinition\theater.lst" file and add the line "Add-On Israel1980s TvT\Terrdata\theaterdefinition\Israel1980s-TvT.tdf";
